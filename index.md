# EduSpark Promise
Here at EduSpeak, we pride ourselves on making a space where learners and educators alike can come together and serve each other in numerous ways. These ways include volunteer tutoring services, a social media-like platform to express, and the opportunity to find others to collaborate on education-based activities and research.  Our goal is to get educators and learners to join us in cultivating a platform that appreciates each player in the education game. By naming our platform EduSpeak, we are choosing to acknowledge the disconnect between educators and learners and bridge that gap by demystifying learning.

As both developers and users of this platform, when we sign our names, we make a promise to uphold these beliefs and goals of EduSpeak: as learners, as educators, and as a community.

### 1. To put learning first.
Before any of the flashy features, we put learning and growing as an individual and as a community. The foundation of EduSpeak was built on the idea that we all deserve to learn, and we all deserve a place that encourages and promotes learning in all of its forms. Because of this, we ask our users to do everything on the platform with the intention of learning and educating. Doing or saying anything with ill intent, no matter how it is worded, is against our core beliefs and is not tolerated on EduSpeak.


### 2. To break down the hierarchy of education.
In traditional learning settings, we know how learning can feel–intimidating, scary, and belittling. Sometimes the title of teacher can seem so, so big and the title of a student can seem so, so small and…insignificant. At EduSpeak, we see that for the lie that it is, and to combat this, we have taken the time to make sure our platform gives all positions in education an equal stance to learn, educate, and speak their minds. Breaking down the hierarchy of education is an important step in opening doors for communication.


### 3. To never charge you for finding your community–ever.
At EduSpeak, we believe that making connections and networking should never come with a price. EduSpeak was made for everyone, and we recognize that putting a price tag on our platform shuts out many users that could benefit from and add more to our ever-growing community. We only ask that you join us in spreading positivity and the love for learning in everything that you do on our platform.


### 4. To create a safe space for everyone regardless of who they are, where they come from, or what their education level is.
When you think of who a learner is, what do you imagine them as? Old? Young? From anywhere in particular? Do they speak a certain language? What about an educator? Do they look a specific way? At EduSpeak, we understand that both educators and learners do not have a homogenous look or background, and we strive to make our platform a safe space for any identities that may interact and intersect with each other. That’s why we hold a zero tolerance policy for anyone on our platform that discriminates on the basis of race, nationality, gender identity, religion, disability, or sexual orientation–so that everyone feels welcome to be here with us at EduSpeak.

**At EduSpeak, we want to make learning accessible for everyone. Will you join us?**
